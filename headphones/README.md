## 🛠️ *Technical Details*

### 1. *Fonts*
   - Fonts used in the Figma design:
     - *Source Sans Pro*: [Download Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
     - *Spin Cycle OT*: [Download Spin Cycle OT](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT-Regular)
   - Ensure these fonts are installed on your system for proper rendering.

### 2. *CSS Implementation*
   - The hover/active states for links and buttons are implemented with the following styles:
     ⁠ css
     /* Links hover/active state */
     a:hover, a:active {
         color: #FF6565;
     }

     /* Buttons hover/active state */
     button:hover, button:active {
         opacity: 0.9;
     }
      ⁠

   - The maximum width of content is defined using the following rule:
     ⁠ css
     /* Center content and set max width */
     .container {
         max-width: 1000px;
         margin: 0 auto;
     }
      ⁠

## 📐 *Design Notes*

•⁠  ⁠Some Figma measurements may include float values. *Values were rounded* for simplicity and consistency.
•⁠  ⁠The mobile version of the webpage switches at a screen width of *480px or less* using a CSS media query:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
      /* Mobile-specific styles go here */
  }
